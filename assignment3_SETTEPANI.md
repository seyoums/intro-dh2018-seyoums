1. Discuss the process of creating your data, building your map in ArcGIS Online, and selecting which points to feature in your Storymap.
  
 When I was making my story map I wanted to show that through the week I do not go to many different places because I am a student athlete and during the time I was making the story map I was also in season, Most of my day is in the robins center as i said in my slide i do my homework there get treated on injures that happened during the game, watch film and practice. 

2. Drawing on the constraints, critiques and ideas outlined by Bodenhamer and Crampton, discuss the challenges of representing space and place as applied to your map. How might you be able to address some of these issues in the future?

One issue that came up when I was making my map it was difficult to show exactly how much time I spent in a specific place. how addressed this issue was the i wrote more about it in its slide also i trio to zoom in closer to the building to show the significance.

3. Limits and possibilities of Mapping/ Spatial Analysis

There are not many limits on mapping the only one that I could think of would be showing exactly what one did in a specific location without zooming in more and having the spot move around. However the possibilities are endless.

4. Include links to your data (google sheet) and StoryMap.
